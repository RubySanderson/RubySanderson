Hello ðŸ‘‹ my name is Ruby Sanderson and this my portfolio.

- âš¡ I am passionate about coding, analysing data, and technological advancements. 
- ðŸŒ± I have recently completed my certificate in Level 3 Data Analysis, and I am eager to enter a permanent full-time role where I can develop my knowledge and skills and be part of the growth of the organisation, as well as be a valuable memeber of the team.

Why technology?
- My passion for technology started with my role-model older brother who loved computer science, and is currently a manager at PwC specialising in Cybersecurity. 
His humble roots began as a Technical Support Technician at 18, and at 21 he started his journey as a Security Analyst.
- Another source of my insterest is my partner who currently works at the University of Birmingham as a Finance Analyst. 
I greatly admire the work and constant development of skills and knowledge that is part of his job, and would love to go into a role with similar responsibilities and development.
